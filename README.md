# Image Editor - High-Performance Image Editor

Image Editor is a professional-grade, web-based image editing suite designed for speed, precision, and efficiency. While many online editors lag or freeze when handling high-resolution files, Image Editor offers a **butter-smooth experience** through advanced optimization. It allows users to apply professional filters and compress images without sacrificing a single pixel of quality.

## 🚀 The Problem Solved

Most web-based image editors struggle with large assets, leading to browser crashes, laggy sliders, and "pixel cutting" during compression. **Image Editor** fixes this by:

* **Zero-Lag Performance**: Uses optimized rendering to ensure a fluid UI even with 4K+ images.
* **Resolution Integrity**: Our compression engine reduces file size while maintaining high-definition clarity.
* **Universal Compatibility**: Effortlessly handles any image format (PNG, JPG, WEBP, etc.) and any file size.
* **Optimized Memory Management**: Efficiently processes images locally to prevent browser slowdowns.
